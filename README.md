## Description  

**query-spec-combined-sorted.csv** contains the annotation of the queries along with annotations from three annotators. The following describes the properties shown in the file:  

- **PID**: A numeric ID associated with users in the experiment.  
- **query**: User-formed queries.  
- **topic**: A numeric label associated with the topic and backstory given to the user during the experiment before forming the query.  
- **Specificity_{id}**: Query specificity classification given by an annotator.  
  - `1` = Non-specific  
  - `2` = Specific  
- **Specificity Level**: Combined query specificity based on the majority of annotators' specificity ratings.  

Additionally, the annotators' responses to each question are included to show their thought process during the annotation.
